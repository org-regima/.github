## Problem

Trellised walks have their own special beauty. They are so unique, so different from other ways of shaping a path, that they are almost archetypal.

Where paths need special protection or where they need some intimacy, build a trellis over the path and plant it with climbing flowers. Use the trellis to help shape the outdoor spaces on either side of it.

## Discussion

. . . suppose the main spots of the garden have been defined - OUTDOOR ROOM (163), TREE PLACES (171), GREENHOUSE (175), FRUIT TREES (170). Now, where there is a special need to emphasize a path - PATHS AND GOALS (120) - or, even more important, where the edges between two parts of a garden need to be marked without making a wall, an open trellised walk which can enclose space, is required. Above all, these trellised walks help to form the POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACES (106) in a garden or a park; and may perhaps help to form an ENTRANCE TRANSITION (112).

In PATH SHAPE (121), we have described the need for outdoor paths to have a shape, like rooms. In POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE (106), we have explained the need for larger outdoor areas to have positive shape. A trellised walk does both. It makes it possible to implement both these patterns at the same time - simply and elegantly. But it does it in such a fundamental way that we have decided to treat it as a separate pattern; and we shall try to define the places where a trellised structure over a path is appropriate. 1. Use it to emphasize the path it covers, and to set off one part of the path as a special section of a longer path in order to make it an especially nice and inviting place to walk. A trellis gives shape to an outdoor area. 2. Since the trellised path creates enclosure around the spaces which it bounds, use it to create a virtual wall to define an outdoor space. For example, a trellised walk can form an enormous outdoor room by surrounding, or partially surrounding, a garden. Think about the columns that support the trellis as themselves capable of creating places - seats, bird feeders - COLUMN PLACES (226). Pave the path with loosely set stones - PAVING WITH CRACKS BETWEEN THE STONES (247) - Use climbing plants and a fine trellis work to create the special quality of soft, filtered light underneath the trellis - FILTERED LIGHT (238), CLIMBING PLANTS (246) . . . .
