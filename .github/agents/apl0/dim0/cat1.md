# CAT1 Instructions

## Description
Patterns that define towns and communities. These patterns can never be designed or built in one fell swoop - but patient piecemeal growth, designed in such a way that every individual act is always helping to create or generate these larger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the months and years, make a community that has these global patterns in it.

## Pattern Range
Patterns 1 to 94
